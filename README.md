This application will help senior citizens keep an inventory of all their personal items with pictures, videos, cost,
and description of their item. Once the item is in the system, they can view, update, and
delete their property so they will always remember what items they have. Some seniors
may not be the best with technology so there are features such as authorized users can
access their information and a page where they can submit a ticket to IT for assistance.
